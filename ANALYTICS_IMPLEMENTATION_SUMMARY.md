# AskBucky Analytics Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive, privacy-friendly analytics system for AskBucky that enables data-driven decision making. The system tracks user behavior, performance metrics, and operational data while maintaining user privacy.

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Core Analytics Module (`analytics.py`)
- **User Tracking**: Anonymous user ID and session management
- **Event Logging**: Structured JSON events to stdout for Cloud Logging
- **UTM Tracking**: Campaign and traffic source attribution
- **Privacy-First**: No PII collection, secure cookies, GDPR-compliant

### 2. Enhanced API Integration
- **Ask Endpoint**: Tracks query start, completion, and performance
- **Sites Endpoint**: Page view tracking for site discovery
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and logging
- **Latency Monitoring**: Response time measurement and logging

### 3. Middleware Integration
- **Automatic Page Views**: Tracks all GET requests to static content
- **Error Tracking**: Catches and logs application errors
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks slow requests (>1 second)

### 4. Enhanced Core Handler
- **Qdrant Metrics**: Vector search performance tracking
- **Source Counting**: Accurate tracking of results returned
- **Status Determination**: Success/empty/error classification
- **Final Analytics**: Comprehensive end-of-query metrics

### 5. Operational Tracking
- **Daily Jobs**: Data loading and maintenance job status
- **Qdrant Performance**: Vector search hit rates and timing
- **System Events**: Background process monitoring

### 6. Infrastructure Setup
- **BigQuery Integration**: Automated dataset and sink creation
- **Cloud Logging**: Structured event streaming
- **IAM Configuration**: Proper permissions setup

### 7. Analytics Queries
- **DAU/MAU**: Daily and monthly active users
- **Conversion Rates**: Session-level success tracking
- **Retention Analysis**: User return rate calculations
- **Performance Metrics**: Success rates, latency, error rates
- **North Star Metric**: Daily Satisfied Answers (DSA)
- **Traffic Analysis**: UTM source attribution
- **Site Performance**: Per-site success rates and usage

## üìä Metrics Tracked

### User Metrics
- **DAU/MAU**: Distinct users per day/month
- **Conversion Rate**: % of sessions with successful answers
- **Retention**: 1-day, 7-day, 30-day user return rates
- **Churn**: User loss rate calculation

### Performance Metrics
- **Answer Success Rate**: % of queries returning results
- **Latency**: P50, P95 response times
- **Qdrant Hit Rate**: Vector search effectiveness
- **Error Rates**: Application error frequency

### North Star Metric
- **Daily Satisfied Answers (DSA)**: Successful answers with sources and fast response time

### Operational Metrics
- **Daily Job Status**: Data loading success/failure rates
- **Site Performance**: Per-site usage and success rates
- **Traffic Sources**: UTM campaign attribution

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Event Schema
```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "event_name": "ask_answered",
  "event_time": "2025-08-19T12:34:56Z",
  "user_id": "ab_0c7f...e1",
  "session_id": "sess_20250819_1234",
  "props": {
    "site": "gordon-avenue-market",
    "sitetag": "menus_2025-08-19",
    "status": "success",
    "sources_count": 3,
    "latency_ms": 1420,
    "query_len": 48,
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "qdrant_hits": 41,
    "utm_source": "direct",
    "utm_medium": "(none)",
    "utm_campaign": "(none)"
  }
}
```

### Event Types
- `page_view`: User visits a page
- `ask_started`: User submits a question
- `ask_answered`: Question is answered (success/empty/error)
- `error`: Application errors
- `daily_job`: Background job execution
- `qdrant_metrics`: Vector search performance

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Features

### Data Minimization
- No PII collection (names, emails, etc.)
- Anonymous user IDs (cookies)
- Session-based tracking (30-minute windows)
- No IP address logging

### User Control
- HTTP-only, secure cookies
- Users can clear cookies to reset tracking
- No cross-site tracking
- Data stays within your Google Cloud project

### Compliance
- GDPR-friendly (anonymous data)
- No third-party tracking
- Full data ownership
- Easy data deletion capability

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `analytics.py`: Core analytics module
- `setup_analytics.sh`: BigQuery infrastructure setup script
- `analytics_queries.sql`: Ready-to-run SQL queries
- `test_analytics.py`: Comprehensive test suite
- `ANALYTICS_README.md`: Complete documentation
- `ANALYTICS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: This summary

### Modified Files
- `webserver/routes/api.py`: Enhanced API handlers with analytics
- `webserver/middleware/__init__.py`: Added analytics middleware
- `core/baseHandler.py`: Enhanced query tracking and metrics
- `robust_load_today.py`: Added job status tracking

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Deploy to Cloud Run**: Deploy the updated application
2. **Run Setup Script**: Execute `./setup_analytics.sh`
3. **Verify Data Flow**: Check that events are reaching BigQuery
4. **Test Queries**: Run sample analytics queries

### Monitoring Setup
1. **Set Up Alerts**: Create Cloud Monitoring alerts for key metrics
2. **Dashboard Creation**: Build BigQuery dashboards for key metrics
3. **Cost Monitoring**: Track BigQuery and logging costs
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor analytics overhead

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] User feedback tracking (thumbs up/down)
- [ ] A/B testing framework
- [ ] Cohort analysis dashboard
- [ ] Revenue tracking (when applicable)
- [ ] Advanced funnel analysis

## üß™ Testing Results

The analytics system has been thoroughly tested:
- ‚úÖ All core functions working correctly
- ‚úÖ Event format validation passed
- ‚úÖ Middleware integration successful
- ‚úÖ JSON output format correct
- ‚úÖ Cookie management working
- ‚úÖ UTM parameter extraction functional

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### BigQuery Costs
- Events stored in `_AllLogs` table
- Consider partitioning by date for cost optimization
- Monitor query costs and set up alerts
- Implement data retention policies

### Logging Costs
- Events stream to Cloud Logging first
- Monitor log volume and set retention policies
- Consider log exclusion filters for non-analytics logs

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Track what matters for AskBucky's success
2. **Privacy-First**: User privacy maintained throughout
3. **Self-Hosted**: Full control over data and infrastructure
4. **Real-Time**: Immediate insights into user behavior
5. **Comprehensive**: Covers user, performance, and operational metrics
6. **Scalable**: Built on Google Cloud's robust infrastructure
7. **Cost-Effective**: Uses existing Cloud Run + Logging + BigQuery stack

## üìû Support

The analytics system is production-ready and includes:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Test suite for validation
- Setup scripts for infrastructure
- Ready-to-run SQL queries
- Privacy compliance features
